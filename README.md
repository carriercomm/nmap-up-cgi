A script to see who's connected to the network, and display the list on a nice web page.
If the hostname matches the list of known computers configured on my network, it appears in blue. Otherwise,
it appears in red. I'm getting my list of known hosts by connecting to my router, but you can use a text file (the lines which are commented out).
